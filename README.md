## 🧠 About Me

I'm a **Civil Engineering graduate** turned passionate technologist, blending traditional engineering thinking with modern **Full Stack Web Development**, **Embedded Systems**, and **AI/ML**. I believe in using technology not just to solve problems—but to solve *the right* problems, sustainably and intelligently.

- 🔬 Currently preparing to pursue a **PhD in Computer Science & Engineering at IIT Kanpur**  
- 🎯 Long-term goal: To become a **researcher in industry**, focusing on intelligent and scalable systems (esp. AI + Edge + Web + Embedded)
- 🧑‍💻 Actively learning and building projects in:
  - Full Stack Web Development (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, MongoDB, Prisma)
  - Embedded Systems for UAVs (C/C++, ROS2, PX4, MAVLink, Sensor Fusion)
  - AI/ML Model Optimization for Edge Deployment (YOLO, TensorRT, Quantization)
  - WebGIS using Leaflet.js and GeoJSON
